This project was developed during our course on Scientific Storytelling and Critical Thinking, under supervision of Prof. Jacopo Grilli at the ICTP. 

In this project we have 2 files: A.fna and B.fna.
One of them corresponds to A DNA sequence (for E. Coli) and the other one corresponds to a non-sensical sequence of nucleotides.
Our goal is to find out which one is the ``correct'' sequence (that corresponding to E. Coli) without any prior knowledge about the actual DNA sequence for E. Coli.
